<h1>The Stack Abstract Data Type</h1>

<p>A <strong>stack</strong> is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represent those that have been in the stack longest. The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed first. This ordering principle is sometimes called <strong>LIFO</strong>, last-in first-out. It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. Stacks are fundamentally important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items. The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal.</p>

<h1>Operations</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stack(  )</strong> - creates a new stack that is empty. It needs no parameters and returns an empty stack.

  <li><strong>push(item)</strong> - adds a new item to the top of the stack. It needs the item and returns nothing.

  <li><strong>pop(  )</strong> - removes the top item from the stack. It needs no parameters and returns the item. The stack is modified.

  <li><strong>peek(  )</strong> - returns the top item from the stack but does not remove it. It needs no parameters. The stack is not modified.

  <li><strong>is_empty(  )</strong> - tests to see whether the stack is empty. It needs no parameters and returns a boolean value.

  <li><strong>size(  )</strong> - returns the number of items on the stack. It needs no parameters and returns an integer.
</ul>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p></p>

```python

class Stack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return self.items == []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        return self.items.pop()

    def peek(self):
        return self.items[len(self.items) -1]

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)

```

<h1>Performance</h1>

<p>Big-O efficiency of operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>push(item)</strong> - the push method utilizes the Python list's <strong>append</strong> method. To avoid frequent resizing, when a Python list is created, memory is over-allocated. Items are appended to the reserved space in constant time. This is an O(1) operation.

  <li><strong>pop(  )</strong> - the pop method utilizes the Python list's <strong>pop</strong> method. When implemented, a Python list records the base address of the list, and keeps a pointer to the list's length in the list's head structure. When a new item is appended to the list, the length pointer is incremented by one. When an item is removed from the list, the item found at the base address plus the value of the length pointer is returned and the length pointer is decremented by one. This is an O(1) constant time operation.

  <li><strong>peek(  )</strong> - the peek method utilizes the Python list's <strong>len</strong> method. Similar to pop, peek returns the item found at the base address plus the value of the list's length pointer. However, the length pointer is not decremented and the list is not modified. This is an O(1) constant time operation.

  <li><strong>is_empty(  )</strong> - the is_empty method simply returns a boolean evaluation of the size of the list's length pointer. If the length pointer is 0 it returns True, otherwise False. This is an O(1) constant time operation.

  <li><strong>size(  )</strong> - again, the size method utilizes the Python list's <strong>len</strong> method. This operation returns the value of the list's length pointer. This is an O(1) constant time operation.
</ul>
